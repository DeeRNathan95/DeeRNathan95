# About me 


Hi there! ðŸ¤š

I'm a software developer based in Switzerland, passionate about building seamless and efficient applications that make a difference.
With a background in computer science - software engineering, I specialise in crafting engaging user experiences and scalable solutions using JavaScript. 
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on frontend projects to sharpen my skills and contribute to innovative tech environments.
Outside of coding, Iâ€™m always learning â€” whether itâ€™s exploring the latest tech trends, building personal projects, or hiking through Switzerlandâ€™s stunning landscapes. 
I thrive on curiosity, challenge, and continuous growth.


âš¡**Fun Facts:** 
- I'm of Srilankan Tamil heritage, born in Paris, raised in London and now living the Swiss life.
- Football and gym workouts keep me energised and focused âš½
- Nature is my reset button â€” I find peace and inspiration in the outdoors
