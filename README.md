# About me 


Hi there! 🤚

I'm a software developer based in Switzerland, passionate about building seamless and efficient applications that make a difference.
With a background in computer science - software engineering, I specialise in crafting engaging user experiences and scalable solutions using JavaScript. 
Right now, I’m focused on frontend projects to sharpen my skills and contribute to innovative tech environments.
Outside of coding, I’m always learning — whether it’s exploring the latest tech trends, building personal projects, or hiking through Switzerland’s stunning landscapes. 
I thrive on curiosity, challenge, and continuous growth.
