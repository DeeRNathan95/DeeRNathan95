# About me 🦸‍♂️


Hi there! 🤓🤚

I'm Diluxshan (also knowns as Dee), a software engineer based in Zürich, Switzerland.

I’m passionate about leveraging my computer science background to build seamless and efficient applications. I love using JavaScript and Vue.js to craft engaging user experiences and scalable solutions. Currently, I'm working on frontend projects to sharpen my skills, and I’m excited to contribute to innovative tech environments.

Outside of coding, I’m always learning – whether it’s exploring the latest tech trends or building personal projects. I’m also into hiking around Switzerland's beautiful landscapes and finding new ways to challenge myself.

Fun Facts: 
- I'm of Srilankan Tamil heritage, born in France, raised in London, living the Swiss life.
- I love playing football
- I enjoy the beauty of nature
